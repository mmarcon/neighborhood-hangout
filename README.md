# Neighborhood Hangout

**See where your neighbors are hanging out.**

This little application uses heat maps to display interesting places in your neighborhood. It pulls checkin information from the Foursquare API and displays on the map the areas where people normally hangout in your neighborhood and the most popular spots in the area around you.
